#### About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) (OSU), advised by [Prof. Ness B. Shroff](http://newslab.ece.ohio-state.edu/home/) and [Prof. Jia (Kevin) Liu](https://kevinliu-osu.github.io/). Prior to joining OSU, I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Chuan Wu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cwu/index.html), and my B.E. degree from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).

#### Research Interest

My research interests mainly focus on optimizing distributed systems. My research primarily concentrates on designing efficient resource scheduling algorithms for various distributed systems. Recently, I have been working on the analysis and optimization of large-scale distributed machine learning systems.
